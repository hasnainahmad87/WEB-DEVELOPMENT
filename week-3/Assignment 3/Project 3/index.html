        <p>
            Covering over 70% of the Earth's surface, oceans are vital to our planet's health. They regulate climate, provide oxygen, and support a diverse range of life forms. However, they are facing unprecedented threats from pollution, overfishing, and climate
            change. It is crucial that we take action to protect our oceans and the countless species that call them home.
